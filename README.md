# Java-Practice
As a reccent AA graduate at Seminole State I wanted to go through and refresh on some old coding topics that I've leanred throughout the years. This includes Java collections, OOP, sorting algorithms, etc. I will also be posting new topics I would like to learn such as Stream API, Immutable Classes, etc.
